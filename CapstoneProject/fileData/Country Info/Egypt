1. Egypt is renowned for its ancient hieroglyphs. In fact, there are over 700 of them!
The Rosetta Stone was an important tool in translating and deciphering many of these
hieroglyphs, as no one could read the symbols at the time! However, the Rosetta
Stone had the same thing written in Demotic, hieroglyphs, and Ancient Greek. Since
there were people who could read Ancient Greek, the hieroglphys could finally be
deciphered so we can read them today.
2. Egypt is home to the Great Pyramids of Giza, the only surviving Wonder out of
the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
3. Throughout Egypt, there have been tombs that hold sparkling treasures, extremely
out-of-date food, and sometimes even sarcophaguses with bandages and bodies inside.
Maybe you can go searching and come across a lucky find - an untouched tomb
with honey not touched and treasures not stolen in the many years since its creation.
4. Cats were sacred in Egypt. Of course, this is visible in the many depictions of
cats in statues, paintings, hieroglyphs, and even in their gods. If a cat died,
their owner(s) would shave off their eyebrows after mummifying and burying their cat.
As long as their eyebrows didn't grow back, the owners would mourn for the fallen cat.
5. Ancient Egyptians invented a lot of things that are still used today: paper,
cosmetics, toothbrushes and toothpaste, and even a form of breath mint.
